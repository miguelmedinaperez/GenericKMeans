# GenericKMeans
After implementing KMeans twice for different projects I decided to implement a generic version in C# so I could use it in any new project with minimun programming effort. Just implement the interfaces ICentroidsCalculator, IDissimilarityFunction, IFactory, and ISampler, and instantiate the class GenericKMeans to find your clusters.
